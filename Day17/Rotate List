Q. Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]


Code:

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head, k):
        if not head:
            return head
        cur= head
        length =1
        while cur.next:
            cur = cur.next
            length+=1 
        cur.next = head
        k= length - (k%length)
        while k>0:
            cur=cur.next
            k-=1
        newhead = cur.next
        cur.next=None
        return newhead
