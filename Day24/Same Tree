Q. Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 
Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 

Code:


class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        elif p is None or q is None:
            return False

        if p.val != q.val:
            return False

        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
