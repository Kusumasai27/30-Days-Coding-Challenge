Q : Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [True] + [False] * len(s)

        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for w in wordDict:
                start = i - len(w)
                if start >= 0 and dp[start] and s[start:i] == w:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        
        return dp[-1]
